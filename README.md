# Shiffy-128


This project implements the Schiffy128 encryption algorithm in Python. 
Schiffy128 is a simple symmetric encryption algorithm based on the Feistel structure and uses a key length of 128 bits.

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- binascii

### Installing
Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/01-00-11-00/shiffy-128.git
```

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install binascii
```

### Usage

To use this project, run the main.py script. The script performs a series of tests and then encrypts a test message with a given key. The encrypted message is stored in a binary file. The binary file is then read, and the message is decrypted using the same key. The script outputs the decrypted message.
Run the main.py file with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
